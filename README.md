# Doto-2-Ping-Tool
This project was inspired by Daghdha's Dota 2 Region Ping Tester found at http://howdoidoto.com/dota-2-region-ping-tester  
It is completely written in WPF C# and requires .NET 4.0 at least to run properly.    

TODO:  
1- Completely turn the code as object-oriented to improve reusability and maintenability.  
2-
